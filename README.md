# OOP-Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ mini-projects designed to demonstrate concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each project explores different real-world scenarios and algorithmic techniques, including data structures, simulations, and management systems.

## Projects Included

- **Avengers Battle Simulation**  
  Simulates battles between Avengers and enemies, featuring suit upgrades, battle commands, and status tracking.

- **Event Dependency Analyser**  
  Schedules multiple event types (Concerts, Theatre Shows, Weddings) and calculates the maximum profit from non-overlapping events using dynamic programming.

- **Graph Algorithms**  
  Implements classic graph algorithms: cycle detection, strongly connected components, topological sort, and maximum path computations.

- **Graph Data Structure**  
  Provides an undirected graph structure with set operations (union, intersection, complement), edge management, and reachability queries.

- **Library Management System**  
  A basic system to manage library books and members, supporting borrowing, returns, and reporting.

- **Polynomial Analyser**  
  Supports creation and manipulation of polynomials, including arithmetic operations and evaluation.

## How to Use

Each project has its own directory and comes with a `code.cpp` file. To run a project:

1. Navigate to the desired project’s directory.
2. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   g++ -o project_executable code.cpp
   ```
3. Run the executable and follow the input instructions as described in each project’s README.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (such as g++)
